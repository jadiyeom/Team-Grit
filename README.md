# Algorithm Visualization Tool

## Overview

The Algorithm Visualization Tool is a software application designed to create visual representations of various sorting and searching algorithms. This tool provides a dynamic and interactive way to understand how algorithms work by animating their execution on different input data.

## Features

- **Algorithm Support**: The tool currently supports a variety of sorting and searching algorithms, including but not limited to:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search
  - Linked list Creation

- **Input Customization**: Users can input their own data sets or choose from predefined sets. This flexibility allows for a comprehensive understanding of algorithm behavior on different types of input.

- **Visualization**: The tool generates animated visualizations of the selected algorithm's execution on the input data. This includes step-by-step visual representations of the algorithm's operations, making it easier for users to grasp the underlying processes.

- **Speed Control**: Users can control the speed of the animation to observe the algorithm's behavior at different rates, helping them analyze the step-by-step execution more effectively.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jadiyeom/Team-Grit.git
   ```

2. Install required dependecies

3.  Start visualizing

### Usage

1. Select the algorithm you want to visualize from the dropdown menu.

2. Choose or input the data set on which the algorithm will operate.

3. Adjust the speed of the animation using the speed control slider.

4. Click the "Start" button to initiate the animation.

5. Observe the step-by-step execution of the algorithm on the input data.
